# SimpleLwM2m

This project implements a mock LWM2M client. It is able to register, derregister, hold basic objects, instances and resources and interact with a LWM2M server.

It is build on top of [Californium](https://eclipse.org/californium/), and aims to be a very simple and lightweight option for testing or tinkering. It is being used to load test LWM2M implementations with thousands of simultaneous mock clients.

If you need a full-featured LWM2M implemenation, consider using [Leshan](https://eclipse.org/leshan/).
